This portfolio makes use of AWS CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, Lambda,SNS,S3, and a few other services that form a backbone for a CI/CD workflow.  A public github repository is the source control which triggers a webhook when pushed to the master branch which triggers AWS build through Code Pipeline.NPM with Webpack is used to build the bundle along with Bableâ€™s loader, React components , and hest for testing ensuring an intergrated development testing while in porduction workflow. Artifacts get deposited in a statistically hosted S3 bucket (deployed using a serverless python script in Lambda. DNS resolution is provided through route53 with a AWS hosted zone, deplying to edge locations globally using CloudFormation.",
